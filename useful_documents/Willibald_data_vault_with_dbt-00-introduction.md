# Willibald data vault with dbt - 00 - introduction

The German speaking data vault user group ([DDVUG](https://datavaultusergroup.de/)) defined a pretty interesting data set of a seed and plant retailer called Willibald, with lots of data challenges that are pretty common within data warehouse projects.
They then asked vendors of data vault automation tools to set up a data vault data warehouse 
describing how they solved the 13 data challenges hidden within the data.
Together with requirements for business rules and some overarching functions this makes 22 criteria the tool vendors had to solve.
The idea is to have a framework to support companies in their tool selection process.

See [dwa-compare.info](http://dwa-compare.info) for more details on this project and the option to compare the different tools with each other.


We - two freelance data architects with extensive experience in data projects and also many years of experience in data vault and in using automation tools -   
were asked to set up the solution using [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) and [datavault4dbt](https://github.com/ScalefreeCOM/datavault4dbt) an open source package from [Scalefree](https://www.scalefree.com/).

## Original setup of the dbt solution

Here is the setup we defined for the dbt solution we presented at the TDWI in June 2023 in Munich.

Willibald has two different operative systems selling in a webshop and on regular roadshows.
We loaded the data in a datalake into S3. The dataset consists of 3 different data deliveries (we defined them as coming from 2022-03-14, 2022-03-21 and 2022-03-28).

Our data warehouse is running on Snowflake containing the layers documented here, we were using [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) and [datavault4dbt](https://github.com/ScalefreeCOM/datavault4dbt) from [Scalefree](https://www.scalefree.com/).

## Adding business metadata workflow

In the complete solution we presented at the TDWI, we also added [dataspot.](https://www.dataspot.at/) a data governance and data modelling tool 
to define a business object model – owned by the business -  and have all the dbt models up until the Snapshot-Layer generated based on this.

## What is this repository all about

To simplify the installation, we made the S3 bucket containing the data of the source system publicly available. So it should be pretty straigtforward for you to get the solution running in your environment. 


## Tutorials/documents describing the solution

See [README](../README.md).
